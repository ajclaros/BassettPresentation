<h2 id="org7c5a91b">Introduction</h2>
<ul data-fragment-index="1 2" class="fragment">
<li>The brain must be able to use its existing architecture to adapt to its learning environment.</li>
<li>This adaptation happens over various time scales</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org7e1336a">
<h2 id="org7e1336a">Hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Based on studies of modularity, it was expected that FN of motor skill learning would display modular structure over various temporal scales</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Modular structure should change over time during learning, and the characteristics would be associated with learning success</li>

<div class="columns"><img class="top" src="structureofinvestigation.png" height="600" width="600"> </div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">For each time window (days, hours, minutes):</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Parcilated fMRI data into 112 corticle structures</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Generated FC and created a subject-specific weighted functional brain network</li>

<ul class="fragment appear">
<li>At each time point they used the modularity maximization to identify the modularity of the FN. Each time subject&rsquo;s FN had significantly more modularity than a random network</li>

<h2 id="org9860c10">Dynamic modular structure</h2>
<div class="columns"><img class="top" src="temporaldynamics.png" height="600" width="600"> </div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Assessed modular structure of network over time and constructed three null models</li>
<li class="fragment appear">connectional null model: scrambles links between nodes in each time window</li>
<li class="fragment appear">nodal null model: a node in one time window to a randomly chosen node in the previous and next time window</li>
<li class="fragment appear">temporal null model, which we identified by comparing the true multilayer network to a temporally permuted network.</li>

<h2 id="orgdc98e95">Investigation of flexibility</h2>
<div class="columns"><img class="top" src="flexibilityandlearning.png" height="600" width="600"> </div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Defined as the amount of times a node changes module alliance normalized by total possible changes</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Flexibility of the network is defined as the mean flexibility over all nodes</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Expected to use an individual&rsquo;s flexibility in on session as a predictor of learning for the next session.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Regions that were most responsible for predictive power in learning were primarily located in the presupplementary motor, posterior parietal and occipital cortices</li>
<li class="fragment appear">They were not able to predict learning however</li>

<h2 id="org4aff61f">Conclusions (modularity of functional connectivity)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Functional connectivity in learning is segregated into communities that vary over various time scales (days, hours, minutes)</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Connectivity at the shortest time scale exhibited the highest variability</li>

<h2 id="orgce410e5">Conclusions (Dynamic network evolution)</h2>
<p>
Diverse regions of the brain performed different roles within communities:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Some maintain community structure</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Others constantly shift their alliance</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Learning motor skills induce changes in both structure and connectivity, increasing excitability and decreasing inhibition of neural circuits</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org3695e2f">
<h2 id="org3695e2f">Conclusion (Flexibility)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Modular structure varied across individuals but was also shown to be consistent in the whole group</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Flexibility might be characterized by noise - as in signal variability supports mental effort in cognitive operations</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="org14a2fbc">Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">High variablility in lower time scales may not be because of learning.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Can we verify permanent learning over longer time scales? (try same task again at a much later time point and verify its &ldquo;signature&rdquo;)</li>
